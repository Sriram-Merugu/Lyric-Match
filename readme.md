# Lyric Match - AI-Powered Song Guessing Game

Lyric Match is an AI-powered web application that challenges users to guess the title of an English song based on a short, evocative lyric snippet generated by an AI language model. The project demonstrates full-stack development skills by integrating a ReactJS frontend with a FastAPI backend and leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) via the Mistral API for creative lyric generation and dynamic answer evaluation.

## Features

- **Lyric Generation:**  
  - Uses the Mistral LLM to generate a short, 2-4 line lyric snippet for a randomly selected famous English song.
  - The generated snippet is designed to be evocative without revealing the actual song title.

- **Dynamic Answer Evaluation:**  
  - Implements fuzzy string matching (using Python’s `difflib`) to compare the user’s guess with the correct song title.
  - For ambiguous cases, leverages the Mistral API to further evaluate if the guess is correct, accounting for variations such as missing artist names or minor phrasing differences.

- **Modern UI/UX:**  
  - A ReactJS frontend featuring a dark mode, fixed-frame layout, typewriter animations, and futuristic neon effects inspired by cinematic visuals.
  - Responsive design with vibrant animations and engaging interactions.

- **Static and Dynamic Song Sources:**  
  - Uses a static list of famous English songs (with over a billion YouTube views) by default.
  - Optionally, the application can be extended to integrate with external APIs (e.g., YouTube Data API or Spotify API) for dynamic song data.

## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. **Prerequisites:**  
   - Python 3.7 or higher

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Navigate to the backend directory and install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn mistralai python-multipart
   ```

3. **Configure the Mistral API Key:**  
   In `main.py`, set your Mistral API key and model:
   ```python
   api_key = "YOUR_MISTRAL_API_KEY"
   model = "mistral-large-latest"
   ```
   (For better security, consider using environment variables.)

4. **Run the Backend Server:**  
   Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
   The backend will be available at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Frontend Setup

1. **Prerequisites:**  
   - Node.js (v12 or higher)  
   - npm or yarn

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   To install Bootstrap, if not already installed:
   ```bash
   npm install bootstrap
   ```

3. **Start the Frontend Development Server:**  
   Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

1. **Generate a Lyric Snippet:**  
   - On the home screen, click the **Generate Lyric Snippet** button.
   - The backend randomly selects a famous English song (with over a billion views on YouTube) and uses the Mistral API to generate an evocative lyric snippet.

2. **Submit Your Guess:**  
   - Enter your guess for the song title in the input field.
   - Click **Check Answer**. The backend evaluates your answer using fuzzy matching and, if necessary, dynamic evaluation via the Mistral API.

3. **View the Result:**  
   - The UI will display whether your guess is correct or incorrect.
   - In the event of an incorrect guess, the correct song title will be revealed.
